# neetcode-solutions

Here you will find my implementations of data structures and algorithms, which includes [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) solutions.

Each data structure or algorithm may be found in its respective folder.

## Goal

The goal here is to understand and practice implementing data structures and algorithms. C, seems like an adequate language for that. 

### Linked lists

For linked lists I have one common file which solves several of the neetcode puzzles presented on [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/practice).
